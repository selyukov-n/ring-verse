Seven for the Dwarfleaders in their house of stone,
Nine Rings for Men who will become dead

In the land of Mordor, where the Darkthings live.
One Ring to rule them all, One Ring to open their places,
One Ring to put them into the dark prison together
In the land of Mordor, where the Darkthings live.`
